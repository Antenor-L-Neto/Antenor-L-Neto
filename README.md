- 👋 Hi, I’m @Antenor-L-Neto
- 👀 I’m interested mainly in Pyhton projects 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of programming, like HTML, CSS, javascript. I already had classes and courses on pyhton
so I know a little bit of it. Machine learning, bioinformatics and data analysis is now my focus, so Pyhton might be the best call.
- 💞️ In the future (I hope it's not too far) I want to help other people with some projects using the things I'm learning now
