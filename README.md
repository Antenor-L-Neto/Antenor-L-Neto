- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Antenor-L-Neto
- ðŸ‘€ When it comes to programming Iâ€™m interested mainly in Pyhton projects 
- ðŸŒ± I had courses on HTML, CSS, javascript and python, then I was able to develop some projects like a restaurant service sofctware, automatic job seach, webpages, data analysis, learned the basis of machine learning, have experience in molecular docking using bioinformatics and keep looking for ways to improve my knowledge.
- You will find some of the projects in this repository, but feel free to reach me and learn more about my experience.
